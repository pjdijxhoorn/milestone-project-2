<h1 align="center">Coach Helper</h1>

[View the live project here.](#)

This is A website to help Fieldhockey coaches solve a real life problem with their coaching. 
I am a field hockey coach, and a problem that I kept running in to as well as most of my colleagues is the 
subbing(switching) of players and how to keep this as fair as possible. This website is designed to solve that problem 
by listing all the players and giving them stopwatches for both time played and  time on the bench.
accessibility is important because as coach you don't want to drag to much equipment around there for this website is 
designed to be able to work well on phone, tablet and computer.
